# Use the Twilio API

This is the example code for a SMS app that allows you to text a phone number or see a list of top posts on Reddit!

Try texting something to (515) 532-5531 to test it out! You will probably have to text it twice, because it's hosted on Heroku's free tier (and won't respond to the first text in time for Twilio to send you a response).

You can also send a text message by [visiting this site](https://lit-headland-1298.herokuapp.com/) in your browser.
